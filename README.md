## EventHandlingPattern

This project contains the sample codes for EventHandlingPattern talk inside company.

* reactor_example
	* The reactor design pattern is an event handling pattern for handling service requests delivered concurrently to a service handler by one or more inputs. 
	* The service handler then demultiplexes the incoming requests and dispatches them synchronously to the associated request handlers.

* proactor_example
	* Proactor is a software design pattern for event handling in which long running activities are running in an asynchronous part. A completion handler is called after the asynchronous part has terminated.
	* The proactor pattern can be considered to be an asynchronous variant of the synchronous reactor pattern.
